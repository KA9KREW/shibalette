My game is Roulette. Roulette is a very easy to play casino game popular among professional casino players, across the world. Roulette table is easily found in almost every online and land based casino.
 

Objective

The objective of a Roulette game is to bet on one or more than one number which has the maximum chances of being pocketed by the spinning ball.

Roulette game play

The game play for Roulette, irrespective of the variant, is quite simple. You make a bet on any number or numbers and place your chips on the bet you chose. Once you have placed your bet, the wheel is spun and the ball is thrown in. if the ball stops on your chosen bet number or number, you win and get paid for your bet.
 
Instructions

Your initial balance is 25.  Place your bets by clicking on the boxes below.  Each click is a one dollar bet.  If you wish to clear your bets and start over, click on the "CLEAR BETS" button and you can place your bets all over again.
When you are ready to start the spin, click on the "Generate Number" button.  You will then see the winning number in the black box.  This will produce the the winning number.
To see if you won, you will then press the "Check Winnings" button.  You can now check your balance and see how much you have won.

Improvements. 

Ideally, I would like everything to be run on a timer.  
I wanted to also add a lot more jquery plugin such as an actual roulette spinner instead of a gif.
I also would like to add chips directly snap onto the board itself and be able to stack ontop of each other instead of having the chips being displayed above the board and be able to play side bets and corner pets.
